This board was created to make a workbench power supply from an old computer power supply. There are many sites out there that have instructions on how to modify a power supply to convert it to a bench supply but most of them require you to open up the power supply to make the modifications. I wanted something that I could simply plug in and go. This also will allow me to quickly change power supplies in the event that it goes bad.

The board gives access to 12v, 5v and 3.3v from the power supply. There is also an indicator light that will tell you when the power supply is plugged in.

The board was designed in ExpressPCB. It can easily be self etched. Iâ€™ve included all the files for download for anyone that would like to use this.
