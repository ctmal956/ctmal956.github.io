The Renard Servo controller was designed to be able to control hobby servos in line with my Renard controllers. It ‘speaks’ the Renard protocol so it can be placed directly in line with other Renard controllers.
The board was created in ExpressPCB and was designed to be self etchable(if that’s a word).  I’ve included all the ExpressPCB files in the download.

There are 2 versions of the Firmware.  The original has more testing done but in theory v2 is better.  Try them both and see which works better for you.
