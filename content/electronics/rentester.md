This is by far the best thing I have ever made.  I've used it every year to troubleshoot AC issues, DC issues, cabling issues and to just test my controllers.  It's really worth building one.

Its the RenTester.  A diy tester for Renard setups.  The idea is really simple.  The device itself just sends out Renard data to your controllers for testing and accepts data for displaying on the leds.  
The default setup sends 9 groups of 8 channels so you can test up to 64 pics worth of controllers.  (i.e. a Ren64, 4 Ren16's, etc.)
What do I mean 9 groups of 8 channels?  Well, you'll understand better after the video.
