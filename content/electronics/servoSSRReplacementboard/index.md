The SSSRR was created for controlling hobby servos using Renard Controllers that use external SSR’s.  I chose to add isolation to the board.  While this is probably overkill, it’s really a better way to do it.

The project was designed in ExpressPCB and I tried to make it easily self etchable.  All PCB files are included in the download.
