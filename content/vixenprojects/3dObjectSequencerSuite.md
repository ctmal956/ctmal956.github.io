This has been available for awhile but I just realized that I never published it on this website.  Anyway….

The 3D Object Sequencer Suite is a Vixen 2 AddIn and a Vixen 2 Plugin which will aid in sequencing 3d objects for your display.  I suppose the most common 3D object people generally use is the 3D skull.

This version is basically a rewrite of the Skull Sequencer series with some tweaks and one huge new feature:  You can now create your own 3D objects to use with the Suite!

Admittedly, it’s not extremely easy, but it is pretty neat!  I wrote up a bit of a tutorial on how to do it on [youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZZUJjeBhqs)

The release includes a 3 Axis Skull and a Snowman object.
