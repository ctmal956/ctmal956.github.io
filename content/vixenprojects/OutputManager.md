This is a small Addin for Vixen 2.1 meant to simplify remapping outputs of a sequence.  

I'm not sure it's that useful nowadays since most people use FPP to run their displays.

The idea came to me on one of those cold afternoons in December when we had a channel in the display acting up.  Like any other normal person, I didn't want to fix the underlying issue, I just wanted to get the display up and running again quickly and get some hot chocolate.  Well, in Vixen 2, remapping outputs can be a pain.  So, the idea for the Output Manager came to be.
