This is a small Addin for Vixen 2.1.  What it does is it rescales the values of a channel and also can invert values.  It was quickly thrown together to help me sequence the voice for my 3d skull.  

The rescale works like this.  The left value entered has to be the low value and the right is the high value.  Rescaling will map the values (currently they go from 0 to 255) to those values.

Here's the video showing how I used it to sequence my voice.
