I'm really happy with this one...
Blitzen Preview is a new Output plugin for Vixen 2.  It is a direct replacement for the Adjustable Preview.

I used to dread setting up or changing the Adjustable Preview.  So, because, why not, I made a new one.

The main focus for me was to make it easier and quicker for setup and assigning channels.  I also really wanted to make sure that colors for each channel didn't blend.  I use all traditional style leds in my display, no pixels.  I wanted to see the preview closer to what it would look like in real life.

The best way to describe it is just to show the video:
