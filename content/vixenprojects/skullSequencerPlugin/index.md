The Skull Output plugin is a plugin for Vixen 2 to give a 3d visual representation of your Halloween 3d skull.  It has been replaced by the 3d Object suite but I'm keeping this post around because it was part of the beginning of my Vixen 3d programming journey.  The downloads will continue to be available in the downloads section for as long as I can find them.

Here is a sneak preview of my Skull Output plugin for Vixen.
